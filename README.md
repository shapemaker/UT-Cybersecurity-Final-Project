# UT-Cybersecurity-Final-Project

8.18.21

In this final project for UT Austin Cybersecurity Bootcamp, I engaged in an exercise of capture the flag on a vulnerable web server. First in the report, the topology of the network is described and the system of logs and monitoring is laid out. Next, I use nmap to determine the open ports and expose services running on them, followed by an OS scan which returned some critical vulnerabilities to be exploited. The rest, including an executive summary, is included in the PDF. Cheers!
